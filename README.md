### How to generate output

1. Make sure the input files are under the directory 'inputs/'.


2. Run `python3 solver.py` to generate outputs under the directory 'outputs/' (Note that it takes some time for the outputs to compute)


3. Run `python3 prepare_submission.py outputs/ submission.json` to generate the submission.json file
